# Preface {-}
This set of notes document existing and ongoing research efforts 
for fermionic Gaussian computation, also known as fermionic linear optics 
in physics and matchgate computation in computer science. 

It is a rich area of research lying at the intersection of 
physics, computer science, and statistics. 

The main results of this work are: 

- We show that matchgate circuits remain classically simulable 
    (in the sense of both DiVincenzo 2002, Josza 2008) even when 
    allowing arbitrary single-qubit unitaries on a chosen line, 
    We also show that universality is recovered upon extending this condition 
    to two contiguous lines. 
- The simulable gate-set above correspond to 
    fermionic Gaussian unitaries with 
    possibly non-zero mean ï¼ˆdisplaced Gaussian, or DG). 
- By deriving a transformation rule for the 
    effect of DG unitaries with explicit affine structure, 
    we demonstrate equivalence between circuit, Hamiltonian ground state, 
    and fourier characterizations of pure DG states; this generalizes the structure 
    theorem for zero-mean Gaussian states and 
    provides a natural framework to interpret 
    Brod's generalization of zero-mean Gaussian simulation with arbitrary 
    product-state input (Brod 2016). 
- Possibly to-do: map out whole complexity landspace like (Hebenstreit 2020) for 
    DG circuits. 
    
Continuing the line of Fourier results (or do another work):

- Even convolution and CLT, swap test. 
- Magic cumulant provides an tensor-product additive resource measure. 
- Hypothesis: magic cumulant (or some cumulant statistic) is related to 
    the average number of copies required to implement a resourceful 
    state (or the success probability of achieving a resourceful state). 
    Generalize Josza result.
