# General product Gaussian circuits

This work [@brod2016efficient] shows that Gaussian circuits 
with arbitrary product states input and arbitrary product-state 
intermediate measurements remain classically simulable.

::: {.theorem #pimoSimulation name="product-input multiple-output simulation"} 



Let $\{M_n\}$ be a uniform family of (possibly adaptive) quantum 
circuits with $\poly(n)$ Gaussian unitaries over $n$ qubits acting 
on an arbitrary $n$-qubit product state $|\psi\ra = \otimes |\psi_n\ra$. 
The circuit is strongly and adaptively simulable.
